### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I became a bit more comfortable with CSS Grid . 

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

### Continued development

I used the same image for mobile and desktop sites. I am trying to find a way to use different images. Also I am working on modifying image directly using CSS instead of using a already modified image.
